▶️ Running the Project
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Install Required Python Packages
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the dependencies:

pip install pandas 
pip install sqlalchemy pyodbc
Prepare the database

Download the dataset from Kaggle (Retail Order Dataset)
Save the CSV file into the data/ folder of the project (create the folder if needed)
Configure Database Connection
Ensure SQL Server is running on your local machine or a remote server
In the Python script (data_processing_and_load.py), update the DATABASE_URL variable with your database connection string in the following format:
mssql+pyodbc://username:password@server_name/database_name?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server

Make sure the correct ODBC driver is installed on your machine.
Run the Python Script
This will clean the data and load it into your SQL Server database:
 python order_data_analysis.py
Run SQL analysis queries
Open order_details_analysis.sql in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Execute the queries to extract key insights from the loaded data
